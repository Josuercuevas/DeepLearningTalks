# Summer Talk 2018 (September)

In this talk it is intended to introduce you to the world
of deep learning, through a very simple collection of examples.

This talk outline is roughly as follows:

### Basics:
1. Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence (a general idea)

    1.1 The concept of learning
    
    - Detect, recognize, classify
    - Context-interpretation
    - Decision making
    - Basic types of learning approaches:
    - Supervised
    - Semi-supervised
    - Unsupervised
    - Reinforcement learning

2. Deep learning background

    2.1 Tensors and Tensor rank
    
    - Matrix and Matrix operations
    - Activation functions, Neurons, Layers
    - Neural Networks
    - Loss Function, gradient descent

### Training Neural Networks

1. Problem statement
2. What are we trying to solve?
3. Why deep learning?
4. What type of data is required?
5. How much data?
6. Data preparation
7. Data collection
8. Data processing: cleaning, augmentation, preprocessing, formatting.
9. Selecting a proper topology
10. Generalization in deep learning
11. Invariance-Equivariance in deep learning
12. Pre-defined topologies: Resnet, SqueezeNet, MobileNet, VGG, GoogleNet, etc.
13. Pros and Cons of using pre-defined topologies.
14. Defining a custom topology.

### Final thoughts
- How to improve deep learning?
- A single model for everything !
